# Data Mining Project - Ensemble

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook file `Data_Mining_Project_Ensemble.ipynb`, which showcases the implementation of an ensemble approach for predicting heart attack occurrences.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not provided within the repository, but it can be obtained from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?datasetId=1226038&sortBy=voteCount). The dataset contains various attributes related to patient health and medical examination results, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of a heart attack.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `Data_Mining_Project_Ensemble.ipynb` provides an end-to-end implementation of the data mining project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The following sections highlight the major components of the project:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The notebook begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performing an initial exploration of the data. This includes examining the features, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution of the target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** This section focuses on preprocessing the dataset to prepare it for the machine learning models. It involves handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Feature Engineering:** In this step, the notebook explores feature engineering techniques to create additional meaningful features from the existing ones. This may involve feature scaling, feature transformation, or creating new features based on domain knowledge.

4. **Ensemble Model Construction:** The main part of the notebook is dedicated to building an ensemble model for heart attack prediction. It utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, and combines their predictions using voting or averaging methods.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the ensemble model is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook also visualizes the results through confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

6. **Conclusion:** The notebook concludes with a summary of the findings, highlighting the effectiveness of the ensemble approach for heart attack prediction. It also discusses potential areas for further improvement and future research directions.
